# 1984

[WIP]

This is a simple ui from [resin-cams](https://github.com/resin-io-playground/resin-cam). It uses the resin-sdk to display important information about the device and the as well stream the images feed served.

# Warning

Currently resin device urls are too slow to get a realtime feed. We are working on it.

## To try it out:

1. Install [resin-cam](https://github.com/resin-io-playground/resin-cam) on your resin.io devices.
2. Visit http://resin-io-playground.github.io/1984
3. Select your app from the drop down and view your live streams!
